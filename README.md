## Sentry

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Info

This adapter parses (filters) all logs of ioBroker adapters and provides the results as JSON in states for each filter as configured in the settings.
Resulting JSON can then be used in VIS for visualization. States for emptying (clearing) old logs are provided as well (like `logparser.0.filters.Homematic.emptyJson` or `logparser.0.emptyAllJson` to empty all.)

## Installation

Just install the adapter regularly through the ioBroker admin interface. The adapter is both in the latest and stable repository.

## Instructions

I have included all instructions right in the admin settings of this adapter.

Also, you can read most of these instructions here as well:

-   [**Parser Rules (Filters)**](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.logparser/blob/master/admin/doc-md/table-parser-rules_en.md) - for German [click here (Deutsch)](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.logparser/blob/master/admin/doc-md/table-parser-rules_de.md)

## Screenshots of adapter options

Please note that these screenshots are a snapshot and do not reflect the latest adapter options.
This is just to provide you an overview of the adapter options.

-   Will be add later

## Credits

Providing this adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @Mic-M (https://github.com/Mic-M).

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (mcm57@gmx.at). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.
