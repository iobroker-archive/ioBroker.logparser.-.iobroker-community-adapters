#### String / Regex

In the columns _Whitelist AND_, _Whitelist OR_, _Blacklist_, and _Clean_, both normal text (string) and regex are allowed. Separate multiple expressions with commas. Please place regex between `/` and `/`, so that the adapter recognizes if it is a regexp. If String: it is always checked for partial matches. To ignore/disable: leave empty.
